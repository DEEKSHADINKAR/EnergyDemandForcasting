# EnergyDemandForcasting
The model takes the short term (minutes) approach i.e. the time lapse between the data is supposedly very negligible which will in turn increase the preciseness of the calculations made by the distributing system. The system has taken the previous 3 years weather forecasting and electricity demand data of the cities of the northern region including the states Delhi, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand. This data has been used to form the base of the knowledge of the system and has been edified based on this data.

The model system successfully predicts data in real time and produces a calculative amount of how much electricity should be delivered to a city depending on the weather conditions including the main factors like relative humidity, temperature, and rainfall. The real time data will be given to the system in a relatively shorter span of time (minutes) and the values will be recalculated accordingly.

To reduce this gap between the supply and demand while also attempting to counteract redundancies and losses in the amount of energy delivered, we have developed this technology which could predict very precisely how much power should be delivered to fulfill the demand of that region, thus eliminating the chances of supplying more or less than the energy required in the particular region.
